A schema-based matching employs schema-related information, which includes column names, de- scription, inter-column relationships, etc, to find out matched pairs within two different schemas. Cupid. The Cupid [31] framework represents an initial effort of this approach, encompassing linguistic matching of column names, which calculates similarity through synonyms and hypernyms, and structural matching that examines the hierarchy between columns, considering their containment relationships. Column matches are determined by weighted combination of these linguistic and struc- tural similarities. Similarity Flooding. Similarity flooding [33] is schema-matching method that uses graph representations to assess relationships be- tween columns, initiating with string matcher that identifies potential column mappings through common prefixes and suffixes. This method then expands the search for matches by propagat- ing similarities; if two columns from different schemas are similar, 5.2.2 Value-based Matching. A value-based matching is data-oriented, focusing on utilizing statistical measures to explore relationships between values under different columns. Distribution-based. A distribution-based schema matcher [58] utilizes the Earth Mover Distance (EMD) to measure how much effort is required to transform one column set of values into another, focusing on their rankings. Initially, it clusters columns using pairwise EMD calculations. Next, clusters are broken down into matched pairs using the intersection EMD, metric grounded in two principles: columns sharing many values are likely related, and columns with minimal intersection are matched if they both significantly overlap with third column.\"\n",

Most of the included studies had high overall risks of bias and applicability concerns. Few of the papers satisfied any of utility criteria [18]. Several studies highlight obstacles that should be overcome and measures that should be taken before deploying biomedical QA systems. For example, one general-domain QA user study [93] found that users tended to prefer conventional search engines as they felt less cognitive load and were more effective with it than when they queried QA systems. We note that commercial search engines are likely to benefit from comparatively vast development resources, and focus on user experience. By contrast, the academic research we found tended to focus on the underlying computational methodology/models, with little attention to the user interface or experienceaspects which are likely highly influential in how QA systems are used. Law et al. [94] found that presenting users with causal claims and scatterplots could lead users to accept unfounded claims. Nonetheless, warning users that correlation is not causation led to more cautious treatment of reasonable claims. Additionally, Schuff et al. [96] and Yang et al. [95] explored metrics for assessing the quality of the explanations: 22 answer location score (LOCA) and the Fact-Removal score (FARM), F1 score and exact matches.\"\n",

Category 1: Consumer-Oriented IoT 1) Security challenges: Consumer-oriented devices are de- signed to improve convenience and streamline users lives, but they also bring forth security and privacy challenges. One notable security issue in speech-based voice assistant systems is the voice squatting attack (VSA). These IoT devices often rely on third-party natural language processing services, which introduces risks such as security threats and potential data leaks. IoT vendors commonly out- source natural language processing to third-party providers, but cloud servers like Amazon and Google may not effectively identify security vulnerabilities associated with these third- party services. As result, malicious apps from third parties can infiltrate users phones, posing significant risk of stealing sensitive user information. Precise accuracy in voice command recognition is crucial for reliable performance in voice-based systems. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities by mimicking user voice with certain alterations, potentially leading to unauthorized access, including for financial accounts. Attackers may also install ma- licious apps on users phones, increasing the risk of financial loss [33][35]. Notable examples of speech-based IoT devices include AI- powered voice assistants like Google Assistant, Apple Siri, and Microsoft Cortana. These devices further emphasize the importance of addressing security issues to safeguard user privacy and protect against potential attacks. Interoperability issue and unauthorized access on the interconnected network are other security issues for cloud-based IoT. Interoperability issue occurs when the device allows multiple apps to coexist. one such example is Samsung SmartThings, which is suscep- tible to 20 different security vulnerabilities [36].\"\n",

Another modular benchmark emphasizes the concept of modular task boards where benchmark' parts are grouped into three domains: cubes, conductors and gears [13]. The main metrics for the benchmark' design were relevance, representativeness, cost-effectiveness and time efficiency. A notable feature of this benchmark is the incorporation of real electrical circuitry into the 3D printed models. Benchmarks have also been introduced for various other robotics sub-areas and applica- tions. The RLBench is benchmark and learning environment designed for robot learning [9]. It includes variety of unique hand-designed tasks and it was built upon the virtual robot experimentation platform (V-REP) [14]. In order to continually advance and improve the benchmark, task creation tools were developed. Another benchmark is presented for assessing mobile robot local planning approaches [17], encompassing diverse simulation sce- narios and metrics such as safety, efficiency, and smoothness of motion.
