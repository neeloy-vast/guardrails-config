This is little bit of complicated object to work with. However, since rejection ends the game and there is no recall, it is possible to compute the unique belief that arises in continuation play given strategy σ and state (µt, It) as fσ(µt,It)(µt). Thus, given prior belief µ0 and strategy σ, deﬁne sequence of induced beliefs {µσ } and an induced permutation τσ ∈ SI over boxes inductively as follows: (1) Fix prior µ0. Deﬁne τσ(1) = σ(µ0, I) and µσ = ,,(1) (Ho). (2) For any ≤ I, and the induced sequence {µσ , τσ()}−1 =1, deﬁne τσ() = σ(µσ −1, It) where It = I {σ()}−1 =1. Similarly, inductively deﬁne the belief µσ = fτσ(). (3) If < I, continue with step (2) again with the sequence {µσ , τσ()} =1 and time + 1. If = I, deﬁne the observed inspection order given σ to be {µσ , τσ()}I =1 I will sometimes refer to τ as search order and {µσ } as the induced beliefs. Note that each σ induces unique inspection order. In particular, τσ is deterministic, since acceptances end the search process.

The number of points earned by team in each performance indicator is calculated based on the rules of the competition in the given year. For each team, the Defense Score is defined as negative integer denoting the total number of points that is the opposing alliance score during match. This attribute aims to evaluate robots on how well they “play defense” during match (.., blocking the shots of other robots, getting in their way without causing fouls, etc.). 2) Extract Individual Robot Statistics: The individual scores for each competing robot are computed by collecting every match in which the robot presents and calculating the mean of their alliance’ performance in every performance indicator.

We check to see if the current value of the attribute matches value rated as bad for either parent 1 or parent 2 (where that match may be exact or similar, determined with another GPT-4 prompt, again making use of its knowledge of language). If it is match then the attribute is added to the attributes to mutate list. If an attribute is unrated, then there is 50% chance it will also be added to the attributes to mutate list (this is to allow more exploration, as users may not always rate something). We then pass the list of attributes to mutate to GPT-4 (along with the list of all tabu values rated bad by the user) and specify that it should provide novel alternative for each attribute that do not match the tabu values. For example, if site must not have the values [“Rural setting”, “Coastal cliffside”], then the new random value might be “Mountainous highland”. Again, we make use of GPT-4’ knowledge of language to generate new alternatives, so we do not need dictionaries or look-up tables of possible words ( more restrictive and time- consuming method).
